# Sram 22

"A configurable SRAM generator"

---

# What is Sram 22?

* Generates SRAMs of various sizes
* Input: number of rows and columns
* Outputs: GDS file, SPICE netlist

---

# By the numbers

* 100% Rust (*)
* 100% programmatically generated (excluding SRAM cells)
* 4 stars on GitHub
* 0 dependencies on other tools
* 0% `layout21tetris` (sorry Dan)
* 100% `layout21raw` (with a reasonable number of extensions)

(*): Sense amps are BAG generated

---

# Goals

* Build SRAMs
* Build a framework for custom layout in a language better than Python

---

# Read operation

* Posedge of clk
* Registers capture row/col address
* Bitlines precharged
* Negedge of clk
* Wordline drivers turn on
* Multiple cells discharge replica bitline, so it discharges faster
* When replica bitline flips an inverter, timing multiplier is triggered
* Timing multiplier generates sense amp enable signal
* Bitlines are compared and data is sent to output registers

---

# Layout status

"Done":
* Bitcell array
* Row/col circuitry (decoders, R/W muxes, precharge)
* Sense amps (thanks Felicia)
* Timing multiplier

In progress:
* Power strapping
* Top level routing

Not started:
* Replica bitline (unclear how to DRC-check this)
* Merging wells and filling in taps

All generators are parametric.
Can adjust the W/L of any transistor.
(Though some W/L combinations may lead to DRC violations.)

(Can look at layout now.)

---

# Verification status

* DRC: TODO
* LVS: TODO
* More thorough functional simulation: TODO

(Anyone want to pitch in? Help appreciated!)

---

# Schematics

(Sorry, I only have netlists.)

(Can draw things on the board.)

---

# Code review

Suggestions on the code would be very welcome.

It's probably somewhat hard to read now; sorry.

Repo: [https://github.com/rahulk29/sram22](https://github.com/rahulk29/sram22).

My somewhat modified version of Layout21: [https://github.com/rahulk29/Layout21](https://github.com/rahulk29/Layout21).

@Dan: some things may be possible to merge back into Layout21.

# Commercial SRAMs

Want to look at:
* Timing signals
* Typical sizes
* Interface
